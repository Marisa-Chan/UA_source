2101  = ... and finally tonight some bad news. \The sixth Resistance Champion selected \to engage in our multifront war has \perished under Ghorkovian hands. Falcons \in Missing Man formation will fly over \Hyde Park tomorrow during the scheduled \memorial. ... \     --Resistance Nightly News, \       3/17/2071 \ \BOTTOM LINE: You are going to die. But \read our mission briefings and we can \help you live longer. And who are we? We \are the stored memories of the best \Host Station masters who came before \you, went into battle and, upon death, \were digitally linked into the network. \We come bearing knowledge. \ \THE PLAN:  This is your final training \mission. This region is the foothold to \the rest of the continent and contains a \long-abandoned power station that, if \reacquired, can be reactivated to supply \power to our own Resistance forces \once again. Create several Foxes and \lead them 3 sectors SE to conquer the \power station. Then increase its energy \output by conquering as many \surrounding sectors as possible. Central \AI warns that Ghorkovian forces staged \at outlying fringes may interdict with \Ghargoil 1 attack helicopters. If so, \terminate with extreme prejudice.
2102  = ... The Fox? Fast. Ground-to-air capable.\Cheap. Hell yes--one of the best products\from Stoudson Corp. Wish we had more in \the early days. \     --From interview with retired Defense  \       General Weissflog \ \BOTTOM LINE:  The Ghorkovs zealously \guard Virgin Steel, as it includes the \area's only power station. You absolutely \must capture this power station sector in \the northwest corner. Central Encryption \believes that it has broken the Ghorkovian \power translation code, so you should be \able to plug into its power. After \capture, immediately beam your Host \Station to this sector and conquer the \surrounding sectors to maximize power \flow to your Host Station. The risk in \capturing versus destroying is that it \can be taken back. Beware of the dreaded \Ghorkovian fast-turbine landcraft: \the Speedy! \ \BIG NEWS:  Central AI reports that \somewhere within this region is a \technology upgrade sector for a powerful \new tank, the Jaguar.
2103  = And the teacher asked, 'Who can tell me \why the Moon has a dark side?'  'So it \would never have to see what happened \at Skull Alley,' the orphan replied. \     --Resistance Reader Magazine \ \BOTTOM LINE:  Skull Alley! The brutal \Ghorkovs turned it into a penal colony \and then a research center using our \captured scientists. Energy is \everything in this war. Capture the \Ghorkovian power station sector to the \northeast, and then regain the works \of our scientists by capturing the \technology upgrade sector to the \west. Beware of an elite Ghargoil 2 \squad, the Red Rain. \ \NOBODY LIKE YOU:  No machine can fight \with the skill and human heroics that \you possess. Every chance you get, \jump into a vehicle, lead the fight, and \pick up valuable plasma residue for \more energy. Your forces will enjoy an \advantage.
2104  = ... We've been at stalemate here so long\it's hard to tell who owns what \anymore. If someone can just break \through their flak line. ... \      --Interview with Resistance \       Med-Tech S. Priebus, staff #31767 \ \BOTTOM LINE:  We're fighting at Check-\Point Bordeaux, long known as \Checker Board for the patchwork of \Resistance and Ghorkovian sectors. Your\primary mission is to knock out the \enemy's line of gun stations on the \northern perimeter. Intelligence \reports that the Ghorkovs are test-\deploying a ferocious new tank, called \the Tekh-Trak. Also, this region's tech\upgrade will yield our new Wasp fighter \'copter. \ \YOUR PRESENCE REQUESTED:  We'll beam\into battle behind a line of our own \existing flak stations. Jump onto one of\the gun turrets to beat back advancing \forces. Your presence on the battlefield\will definitely be required for victory.\So jump into a vehicle and beware of the\Tekhs!
2105  = I freakin' told them but they didn't \listen!  Never, never enter battle \at Twin Rocks--the 'Kov's have a special \thing for that place. ... \      --SDU 5 Post-Death Debrief \       (restored 7/15/2016) \ \BOTTOM LINE:  Sorry, but our entry \coordinates are set for Twin Rocks: You \will see action immediately. Another \problem: Multiple Ghorkovian host  \stations have been detected, including \the more powerful Turantul II, which can \produce huge complements of \Ghargoil 2s. Central AI reports that a \Scout spy satellite can be captured in \a technology upgrade sector. Look for \a power source near you ASAP. \ \TAKING IT WITH YOU:  As you know, the \beam gate can take vehicles from one \mission to the next when you drive them \onto the beam gate platform before \transporting your Host Station to it. \We have recalibrated our Beam Gate \Network so that room for one more \vehicle is made each time you destroy \an enemy host station.
2110  = By the time we heard about the Mykonian \Labyrinth, the Ghorkovs were already \there, trying to figure  out just what \the weird terraforming Mykonians had \been up to. \      --SDU 2 Post-Death Debrief \       (restored 3/17/2014) \ \BOTTOM LINE:  Clear the Ghorkovs from \this giant maze so our scientists can \analyze why the Mykonians have been \digging labyrinths. Steeply walled terrain \will require careful planning. \Helicopters are advantageous if you \have them.  Launch Scout spy satellites to \locate power stations and technology \upgrade sectors, as we calculate their \presence at a 92.7% probability. \ \TIP:  When fighting in large battle \arenas, effectively monitor the action \by holding down the right mouse button \on the map and dragging quickly to move \the map around.
2111  = So, you're offering me life everlasting \in the Host Station Memory Bank, \right? It's a deal, if you'll just erase \everything I saw in Dark Valley. \      --Host Station Archives \       2231.44578.GSF.2-8-50 \ \BOTTOM LINE:  Everyone on the home \front is pulling for you. The Ghorkovs \have turned this once-industrial area \into a weapons manufacturing region. \You must destroy the Ghorkovian power \station sectors (north) to stop their \production  of new weapons. Also, a \Stoudson Bomb, capable of destroying all \enemies and buildings in the region \with a single shockwave, has been \activated somewhere in this region. It \will detonate and destroy all of your  \forces unless you deactivate it. You  \must proceed north to find the  \Stoudson Trigger sector (black and  \yellow square) and then conquer it to  \stop the bomb's countdown. The  \probability is 89.2% that you will  \encounter Speedy platoons and the  \ferocious dual-prop Ghargoil 3 bomber \'copter. Fortunately, we will beam into \battle just south of two of our own \power stations, although they still \need to be captured. \ \TIP:  Because transporting your \Host Station to a conquered power \station does not cost any beam \energy, no matter how far, hop from \one power station to another to \quickly move and deploy your forces \in this expansive region.
2112  = Is it magic? Some lost metaphysics? We all \know the Taerkastens are tied to the past. \But how do they float those fortresses? \      --Sequential Thoughts for Nonsequential \       Times \ \BOTTOM LINE:  Hate to send you so deep \into Taerkasten territory, but Central AI \reports the existence of a significant \technology upgrade that, if acquired, \will allow you to achieve tactical superiority \over Taerkasten armored divisions. You \will be up against the well-shielded \Leonid tanks, including some commanded \by an especially fanatical cell of the cult. \ \SURVIVAL GUIDE:  Among your predecessors  \here in the Memory Bank, there is a big \aversion to taking on Taerkastens this close \to their home. A prudent move would be to \capture that technology upgrade sector \and then head for the beam gate.
2113  = <OBSOLETE>

2120  = Everything about the Mykonians scared \us--including their cubical ships all \covered with organic tubing. We called \them worm boxes, because that stuff \moved and looked alive. \      --From interview with retired pilot\       D. Mansbart \ \BOTTOM LINE:  This is a risky operation \due to multiple enemies--both \Ghorkovs AND Mykonians--but it is \essential for opening the northern \territories. Your mission is to seek \out and destroy the Ghorkovian \and Mykonian sources of power. Two \recon helis have been predeployed in \a northeastern sector near a \Mykonian power station. Theoretically, \we should be able to obtain this \region's tech upgrades and weaken \the enemy powerbase while the \Ghorkovs and Mykonians are busy \fighting each other. Central AI \calculates that your success rate \may be substantially higher if you \enter this region possessing power \station building  technology.  \ \THINKING OF YOU:  You have impressed \the core AI elements, as you have \progressed farther than 53.9% of your \SDU predecessors. Welcome to the \A-List.
2121  = The Stoudson Bomb was certainly \designed by committee! All those trigger \points--and if someone gets there first, \Goodbye!\ --Bernd Beyreuther, former Stoudson \    Corp. VP of Special Projects\\BOTTOM LINE:  Drak contains the \much-rumored Stoudson Bomb, capable \of destroying all enemies and \buildings in the region with a single\shockwave. The bomb requires multiple\trigger points (black/yellow key \sectors) to be conquered in order to\detonate. Unfortunately, a design \error allows it to be triggered by \enemies as well. Whoever owns all \Stoudson Bomb key sectors and the \bomb itself will annihilate the entire \region. Prevent it from falling into \enemy hands. \ \ENGINEERING REQUEST:  Central AI reports \a technology upgrade sector for creating\power stations. This is your most critical\acquisition to date. Marshal all resources\to gain it.
2122  = Are they alive?  No, but given the way \they'll sometimes show up unannounced \to help defend a host station, it makes \you wonder. \     --Substrate Zero: Artificial \       Intelligence & Being \ \BOTTOM LINE:  Another multifront battle: \The Taerkastens have built a massive \radar station on top of Pedestal \Mountain, guarding it with their own \version of the Stoudson Bomb. They \have been using this Pedestal radar \site to monitor your travails on this \continent. Word has it the Ghorkovs \want it for themselves. Destroy the \radar completely so that it does not \fall into any enemy hands, and then take \out the Ghorkovian and Taerkasten power \stations. \ \SURVIVAL GUIDE:  We beam into the \theater at Pillar Rocks. Capture the \unclaimed power station to the east. \Beware of the Taerkasten Hetzel, an \ancient-looking but deadly plane usually \deployed in large squads. The Ghorkovs \have brought their Ghargoil 3s. A wise  \tactic is to delay the onslaught by  \destroying enemy scout satellites as  \soon as you see them, because your  \enemies cannot deploy units to  \sectors they cannot see..
2123  = The Taerkastens are a mystery. \Supposedly they were the first humans \to meet the Mykonians--a horrific \encounter that sent them into a cultlike \fervor to save Earth from the aliens. \Cool! But why kill us, too? \      --Teenage Manifesto: Thoughts on \       Joining The Resistance \ \BOTTOM LINE:  You have ventured as far \as SDU 5 before we lost contact. Primary \goal: Knock out the Taerkasten Flying \Fortress and its power stations to the \southwest. Central AI reports that \SDU 5's abandoned power station to the \northeast can be reclaimed and tapped \for power as the launch pad of your \major offensive here. \ \SCOUTING AROUND:  To discover hidden \power stations as well as enemy \concentrations, create a Scout. Send it \out on its own, or fly it yourself for a  \bird's-eye view.
2124  =  
2125  = Downlink from The Resistance Training \Command: \ \Welcome SDU 7! Your predecessors on \the front have suffered grave losses, \and Resistance Central AI needs you \battle-ready ASAP. Learn to use your \Host Station controls well. \ \Your first training mission is to destroy \all airborne target drones located north \of your entry point. \ \First, create a new squad of Fox light \tanks by clicking the Create button \(located on the lower left) and then \clicking in the 3-D world. \ \Next, jump into a vehicle by clicking the \Jump into Vehicle button (lower middle) \and then clicking the desired vehicle. \ \Finally, lead your new squad north \toward the target drones. Deploy newly \fitted ground-to-air guided missiles at \the target drones until all are destroyed. \ \Your sentient Host Station will guide \you. Good luck.
2126  = Let him who desires peace, prepare for \war. \     --Vegetius \ \Soon you will be ready for frontline \deployment SDU 7. Your next training \mission is to defeat a larger group of \target drones by deploying your units to \multiple locations using the map. \ \To view where enemy target drones \have been dispersed, display the map by \clicking the Map button. \ \Then, to deploy your squads to multiple \target positions, hold down the left  \mouse button, drag around the units \you want, and then click a destination \point. \ \At any time, jump into a vehicle by \simply double-clicking the vehicle's \icon on the map or by using the Jump \into Vehicle button. \ \Your sentient Host Station will guide \you. Good luck.

2129  =  
2130  = The Mykonian flak station, that \pulsating ring of blue, has a hypnotic \beauty, and the desire to barbecue you. \      --The Hexagon Papers \ \BOTTOM LINE:  We beam into an existing \standoff between the Ghorkovs and \Mykonians to capture a crucial \technology upgrade--the ability to \create  flak stations. Mission: Find and \acquire this tech upgrade, and destroy \both the Ghorkovian and Mykonian \power sources. Be advised that both \enemies are heavily fortified by their \own high-density flak batteries. So \invest in well-armored units when  \rushing enemy positions, and try to find \weak penetration points. Lastly, the  \Ghorkovs have deployed a highly  \accurate squad of Ghargoil 3 bombers in  \this region, so protect your power  \stations with good anti-air units such  \as Foxes.\ \ENGINEERING REQUEST:  The AI Engineering \Module reminds you that each technology \upgrade is vital for future missions.  \Try to acquire all of them.
2131  = Question: The Ghorkovs are human. The \Taerkastens are human. The Resistance \are human. Why can't they get along? \Answer: Because they are human. \      --Joke from a decoded Mykonian \       textbook \ \BOTTOM LINE:  The Clone Commanders, twin \Ghorkovian generals who always fight \side by side, are guarding two power \stations with their twin Turantul IIs. \Central AI believes that they are \readying this plasma-rich region for a \Gigant repair facility. We have lost \two SDU champions here. If you can \reclaim their power stations, we may \have a chance. \ \DIPLOMATIC DISPATCH:  Reports that the  \Ghorkovs hate The Resistance because we \tried to sell them out to the Mykonians \are categorically denied--but true.
2132  = Those Taerkasten crazies like  \their iron and stone,  \Make it float with their  \metaphysical tome.  \Want to kill all on Earth, \and make it their own. \      --The Dying Planet Blues \ \ BOTTOM LINE:  This region is the most \expansive to date, so dig in and plan \on a protracted effort. Prior to losing \SDU 2 here, it was noted that the \Ghorkovs had begun a massive buildup \in this region for unknown reasons. \Your critical assignment is to \ascertain who has the upper hand \and to eliminate all sources of enemy \power. Clearing this region will allow \you to continue farther into the \African continent and perhaps figure \out what the Taerkastens and \Ghorkovs are so afraid of. \ \TIP:  Central AI believes that your  \success rate will be the highest if  \you can first orchestrate a plan to  \damage the Taerkasten powerbase by  \taking out their power station to the  \northwest.
2133  = The Standing Stones of New Stonehenge \are additional evidence that the \Taerkastens not only  worship rock but \have also found a way to draw power from \it. Is this why the Mykonians came? \      --Professor Uli Weinberg, quoted in\       Resistance Quarterly \ \BOTTOM LINE:  We beam into the heart of \Taerkasten holy country to seek out and \terminate key Taerkasten Druids within \their military order. Central AI informs \that their extermination will delay the \execution of 17 captured Resistance \POWs. The Druids are bunkered in Festung \houses to the north. Level these houses \to ensure no survivors, and extract \immediately. \ \DARK TOMORROWS:  The Mykonian Parasite \continues to sap Earth's energy. Someday \you will be asked to destroy it. Gather \all the technology upgrades you can.
2134  = **Earth = Grade 7J battery** supports \Parasite energy extraction for \>=MykoCycle. Upon depletion, proper \disposal is required. \      --Translated from Intercepted \       Mykonian Dispatches \ \CENTRAL AI REPORTS:  Mykonian control  \of this sector jeopardizes all future  \northern offensives.  \ \BOTTOM LINE:  This city is one of the \densest Mykonian-infested regions to \date. The eastern half has already \fallen to Myko-cabling and been rendered \forever uninhabitable. Your mission is \one of reconnaissance. Find out what \the Myko host station is protecting-- \and why. Our information on beam gate  \routing in this region is incomplete. \ \TIP:  You may encounter a new enemy, \the Myko XO1 Quadda. Beware of its  \rapid and relentless firing rate, and  \try not to engage one head-on.

But I \assure you what we ended up with was \100% pure heaven. ... \     --Dr. E. Yuen, lead engineer at \       Resistance Research \ \BOTTOM LINE:  The original mission \parameters for SDU 6 were routine: \Destroy the Ghorkovian Ivory Tower \embassy to the southeast and capture \the Dragonfly tech upgrade.  However, \we have discovered that the Ghorkovs \are already engaged in heavy melee with \the Mykonians and will not hesitate \to engage your forces immediately with \battle-hardened battalions. If you \survive their first attack wave (use \already-deployed Falcons and Hornets \transferred from SDU 6), regroup to \dismantle the enemy's radar \capabilities. Then move on to the \Mykonians. \ \IF ALL ELSE FAILS:  Although we would \prefer to save the region's \infrastructure, High Command authorizes \you to activate all Stoudson triggers \for complete region destruction if \necessary.
2141  = The Rhino Gambit involves confusing the \enemy by creating a large number of \inexpensive weapons, such as the \Firefly. While the enemy deals with the  \pesky attacks, you take command of the  \essentials--such as taking out a radar \or power station, or a juicy mothership. \      --SDU 5 Post-Death Debrief \       (restored 7/15/2016) \ \BOTTOM LINE:  The Taerkastens have \gained control over a Stoudson Bomb. The \Ghorkovs are trying to take it away. \You'll need the technology upgrades \here--should you live long enough to \reach Parasite City. \ \SKY WARS:  It's called the Falcon. Don't\leave without it.
2142  = The Retreat-to-Meet Gambit works when \fighting multiple factions. Fly over one \enemy, then feign retreat, leading them \into the territory of the other. As the \two sides clash, work behind the scenes \to capture or destroy their power \stations. \      --SDU 5 Post-Death Debrief \       (restored 7/15/2016) \ \BOTTOM LINE:  The Ghorkovs dared to \invade Taerkasten territory. Both sides \are entrenched and have formidable flak \stations. As much as possible let them \fight each other, as you attack power \stations and motherships. \ \SPY IN THE SKY:  Central AI requests \deployment of Scout spy satellites to \determine complete enemy positions.
2143  = For centuries humans pondered the \mystery of the pyramids and the secret \of the Sphinx, never knowing that the \alchemy of the Taerkastens was behind \it all. \      --The Hexagon Papers \ \BOTTOM LINE:  We beam into this \Taerkasten stronghold to capture a \prototype of their Bronsteijn flying ion \cannon. Stealing this weapon will \achieve tactical superiority. Once \captured, make extras to carry with you \through the beam gate--as Bronsteijn \plasma formation will occur on only \these ion-rich Taerkasten grounds. \ \ARCHEOLOGICAL NOTE:  Finding where the \Taerkastens hid the Bronsteijn is like \solving the riddle of the Sphinx.
2144  = All of their writhing bionic duct work! \And then we learned that, like an \iceberg, most of it was beneath the \surface, and all of it led back to \Parasite City. So, where is hope? \     --SDU 4 Post-Death Debrief \       (restored 3/19/2015) \ \BOTTOM LINE:  We have found a huge \Mykonian conduit corridor--defended by \three Mykonian host stations. This is \big! Predeployed drones have already \created a stand of flak stations to \cover our entry, but the going will be \tough. \ \ENGINEERING REQUEST:  A crucial weapon  \upgrade has been developed--double-shot  \capacity for the Fox. Please obtain.

2150  = Nightmares rip apart the sleep of anyone \who's ever seen what Mykonians do to a \city. The snaking cables that cover \every surface are actually alive--and \plenty able to seek out and find any \survivors who try to hide. \      --Beyond Human: A Study of \       Mykonian Methods  \ \BOTTOM LINE:  No one has reached this \far into Mykonian territory to date. \There are no human survivors here. This \entire region has been Mykonized so \their data transfer and unit deployment \will be very fast. Expect a rude \welcome. Explore this region and \eliminate ALL Mykonian presence. Your \survival probability is calculated at \7%. God Speed SDU 7.
2151  = Resistance covert ops has always been \a cowboy operation. Their most \outrageous hit was stealing a trio of \Gigants right out from under the  \Ghorkov's noses! \      --Substrate Zero: Artificial \       Intelligence & Being \ \BOTTOM LINE:  At huge risk, some \Ghorkovian Gigants have been liberated \for you and retooled to standard \Resistance controls. You will be able \to advance on the enemy here fighting \fire with fire. How they are controlled \is unknown, but we expect that your \neuronet will adapt with 97% success. \Be advised that same covert ops has  \detected a new class of Ghorkovian \mothership--the Skorpio. \ \ENGINEERING REQUEST:  If any of your \Gigants survive, please take them to the \beam gate before beaming out.
2152  = The power of rocks, soul of the Earth, \Grant us thy power, alchemy, birth. \     --Taerkasten High Priest Sylvius III, \       from Taerkasten Alchemy and the \       End of Gravity \ \BOTTOM LINE:  The Taerkastens use this \region as a staging area where their host \stations are outfitted and recharged. \It is believed that beneath the large \heavily fortified hill is a giant \Taerkasten hive community and supply \lines. Fortunately, a Stoudson \Bomb preactivated by SDU 4 is \available to help you wipe out \the Taerkastens. Goals: Defend the \hill and hold the Stoudson Bomb \and its key sectors for the \duration of its countdown to \destroy all. Also, find an essential piece \of technology that we will need for the \attack on Parasite City--the ability to \terraform radar stations. Grab the radar \technology, and then take the hill long \enough to beam out to safety.
2153  = And then came the Sulgogars, those vast \parasitic jellyfish aliens that float \through the air looking for power \stations to nest on ... and people to eat. \      --The Hexagon Papers \ \BOTTOM LINE:  The Taerkastens are locked \in battle with the Sulgogars in an old \industrial sector. A natural landbridge \divides the two factions. Normally we \wouldn't go near Sulgogars, and just let \the Taerkastens do our work, but there \is a critical technology upgrade we \need--the Warhammer. \ \DISCRETION AND VALOR:  Central AI \suggests you get the Warhammer and \beam to safety. But some of us in the \battle network would sure like to see \you blow apart the Sulgogars along \the way.
2154  = Initially it was thought that  \Sulgogars weren't cruel, that they  \simply saw humans as food. Then  we \got a closer look at what they did to \their food. \      --Confessions to the Memory Bank \ \BOTTOM LINE:  It's a trap, but still we \must go. Sulgogars have created a \fine thread of death, a long corridor \just 1 sector wide guarding Rhino \technology that Central AI feels is \needed for the coming assault on \Parasite City. \ \EATING ENGINEERS:  Good News--Sulgogars \cannot create power stations. If \engineers ever emerged in Sulgogaran \society, they'd be eaten.

2160  = It was meant to be a projection of \power, assurance to the people that The \Resistance would always be there ... but \when we lost the Ring of Power, we also \gave our enemy the ranch. \     --Central AI analyst Sean Kellogg \ \BOTTOM LINE:  Ghorkovs and Taerkastens \once battled here over the Ring of Power-- \a constellation of eight class-A power \stations originally built for Resistance \ operations. Then the Mykonians came,  \destroyed everyone, and sent sentient \snaking bionic extrusions out to prepare \the sector for parasitic conversion. \Reclaim all power stations in the region \away from enemy hands. \ \THE TOMORROW MAKERS:  No one has \progressed as far as you. Our analysts \are recalibrating your odds in our war \models. Continue your assault on the \Mykonians toward Parasite City.
2161  = The key to an effective multifront war \is to eliminate the most uncertain \element first. When the Black Sect \enters battle, deal with them \immediately--and deal with them \completely. \     --Retired SDU Mentor J. Mayo, \       Hyde Park Archives \ \BOTTOM LINE:  Prepare for a long and \exhausting battle. The Anubis Canyons \are huge and contain the heart of the \dreaded Black Sect operations. Central \AI believes that their nerve center may \be within a deep canyon valley 0.8 \kilometer below sea level. Air units are \advised to avoid the maze terrain. \ \YOU HAVE COMPANY:  In hopes of knocking \off the Black Sect as well, the Ghorkovs \have deployed their new host station--\the Skorpio class--in this region. Your \secondary objective is to take out their \supply depot and power stations \southwest of you. It's as if everyone is \heading for Parasite City, yet everyone \wants to arrive alone.
2162  = The Black Sect's origin could be traced \back to the earliest European secret \societies, with all the requisite \branches into the royal families. But \few would dare trace it back. \     --Sequential Thoughts for \       Nonsequential Times \ \BOTTOM LINE:  This wasn't supposed to \happen. The next generation Anvil-class \host station created for you by\Resistance Research has been stolen by \the Black Sect. The source of the leak  \has been traced to SDU 1,  whom we \assume has defected due to her \sudden and mysterious disappearance \in this region. As equal-opportunity  \terrorists, the Black Sect has also  \stolen technology from other factions.  \The Ghorkovs and the Taerkastens have  \thus moved into the area as well.  \Central AI calculates that your  \survival rate will be higher if you  \focus on the Black Sect first. \ \WHAT YOU CAN'T SEE:  The stolen \Anvil-class host station has stealth \projection, rendering it and all of its \networked battle units invisible to your \radar systems.
2163  = The Black Sect has fashioned history \since before there was history, \allowing deluded heads of state to \believe they acted on their own. We \should be flattered that upon stirring \themselves to enter this war, they chose \to steal their host station from our \side. \      --The Hexagon Papers \ \BOTTOM LINE:  Central AI believes the\Black Sect and Taerkastens had once \entered into a technology share \agreement. This deal was rudely severed \when the Black Sect turned 'their' \Bronsteijns against their makers. The \Taerkastens now seek revenge. Covert Ops \has reconverted a series of power \stations for you, allowing you to beam \without cost from one station to the \next. Destroy the Black Sect.
2164  = What secrets are held in the stone of \Earth? Taerkastens float cities with it. \The Mykonian's Parasite City draws power \from it. And now the Black Sect fights \for the ancient Pyramids of Black \Valley. The weirdness of stone! \     --Teenage Manifesto: Thoughts on \       Joining The Resistance \ \BOTTOM LINE:  Resistance science has no \explanation for the powers that the \Taerkastens harvest from their rock \formations. Our only knowledge is that \destroying them weakens their ability \to produce units. It seems the Black \Sect wants to acquire them for their own \dire purposes, so they have occupied a \valley to the southeast. \ \ENGINEERING REQUEST:  Destroy the \Taerkasten Standing Stones shrine. Your \likelihood of success will increase if \you destroy the Black Sect first.
2165  =  
2166  = Is there really a Parasite City? Are the \Mykonians really sucking energy from \the core of Earth? All I know is that \the closer I got to the place, the more \insane the fighting got. \     --Lt. S. Karau, Covert Ops \ \BOTTOM LINE:  The Ghorkovs do not want \you to reach Parasite City and are \attempting to seal off this next \logical route in the beam gate network. \To increase your odds, our analysts \suggest taking the first sector and then \immediately building flak stations and \a power plant. \ \EYE ON THE SKY:  Central AI predicts a \high probability of a Ghorkovian air \attack, heavy with the deadly Gigants.
2167  =  
2168  =  
2169  =  
2170  = If we uploaded praise for the next one \thousand years, it could not begin to \express the gratitude humanity will have \if you can defeat the Mykonians here and \then beam into Parasite City to save the \planet. \     --Direct Input Message from \       The Resistance President \ \BOTTOM LINE:  Central AI has nothing to \say, except that you have far exceeded \our initial performance projections for \you by reaching this stage. We will \monitor your actions to learn. It is \believed that two powerful Myko stations \inhabit this region. Our records \indicate possible Resistance power \station technology somewhere north of \insertion point. \ \NEXT STOP:  Parasite City.
2171  = Back at the academy, we learned that \the intangibles of leadership are far \more important on the battlefield than \material factors. I guess those old \mentors were right. I'll take a decisive \SDU with a wreck of a host station any \day. \     --Resistance High Council Member \       G. Fjermedal \ \BOTTOM LINE:  All we know for sure is \that you will be up against Ghorkovs, \Mykonians, and the Black Sect--that you \will be grossly overwhelmed in numbers. \Beyond that, you are the one with the \knowledge. You are the first SDU to get \this close to victory.   \ \IF YOU WIN HERE:  Prepare for  \Parasite City for the final battle to \liberate Earth from the Mykonians.
2172  = This crazy theory amongst scientists \that the earth itself is a gigantic \organism capable of self-balancing its \many life forms may not be so off base\ ... Ha! Perhaps the Ghorkovs, \Taerkastens, Black Sect, and Resistance \arms race exists solely to send every \damn one of us back into the stone age. \     --Journal Entry of SDU 2 \ \BOTTOM LINE:  All human factions have\ martialed their remaining forces here \for an imminent confrontation with the \Mykonians. The High Council sees this as \an opportunity to weaken all factions' \powerbases prior to Parasite City. Seek \out and destroy the cluster of enemy \power stations toward the region's \center. This way, you may have 34.7% \fewer enemies to deal with on your final \battle--Parasite City.
2173  = Diplomacy could have been our greatest \weapon. If the Taerkastens, Ghorkovs, \and Black Sect had united with The \Resistance, it would have been a \shorter war. But you cannot erase \generations of institutionalized \hatred. \     --Resistance Historian \       Prof. A. Flemming \ \BOTTOM LINE:  This is one of a handful \of entry points into Parasite City in \the beam gate network. Your primary \mission objective is to find either one \of two beam gates in the region and \extract your forces through and on to \Parasite City. However, all human \factions have marshaled their \remaining forces here as well, so the \High Council sees an opportunity to rid \ourselves of our Terran enemies once \and for all. \ \NOTE:  The Black Sect has control of \a  Stoudson Bomb in this region.  \Adjust mission parameters with  \discretion. Many AI drones have been  \remotely redeployed to this region  \to support you.
2174  = You are making possible what was thought \to be impossible. Perhaps you really \can save the planet. We will do whatever\ we can to help. \     --Direct Input Message from \       The Resistance High Council \ \BOTTOM LINE:  Absolutely nothing is \known of this region, as no Resistance \forces have ever reached it until now. \The probability is 98.2% that you \will encounter the following combination \of enemies: Taerkastens, the Black \Sect, and Sulgogars. \ \NEARLY THERE:  Victory here means that \we can beam into Parasite City for the \final battle.  \ \Good luck.
2175  = << transmission incomplete: upload \severed >> \      --Direct Input Message from The \       Resistance High Council \ \ BOTTOM LINE:  ***** \ \ << transmission incomplete: upload  \severed >>

2490  = Tip:  Playing the first three training missions \and watching the training videos are \HIGHLY recommended.
2491  = Tip:  The human factor is key to victory, \so take first-person control of your \vehicles as much as possible. No AI can \match the Intangibles of Human \Leadership.
2492  = Tip:  Three keys to winning are: acquire \power stations, expand your territory \to increase your power stations' output, \and take first-person control of your \vehicles.
2493  = Tip:  Jumping into a vehicle dramatically \increases its firepower, firing rate, \maneuverability, and shielding. Your \direct first-person control makes a \vast difference.
2494  = Tip:  Energy is essential for survival. \Conquer power stations and then acquire \surrounding sectors to increase their \output.
2495  = Tip:  When you take direct control of \a unit, you may press the L key to become \the squad leader.  Any target you \shoot at will become your entire \squad's target.
2496  = Tip:  Pay attention to your energy \absorption, shown in the upper-left \corner of the screen. If the percentage \is low, conquer more sectors to increase \your power stations' output.
2497  = Tip:  All power stations you own require  \a certain number of conquered  \sectors to support them before they  \are at optimal power output.  \For each white box on your power  \station, you must own 16 more  \sectors to become 100% efficient.
2498  = Tip:  When flying a helicopter, raise the \throttle to gain lift, and then move \forward by tilting the helicopter slightly \forward. Hit the brake to auto-level.
2499  = Tip:  Capture as many sectors as \possible to expand your territory and \increase your power stations' output. \As your enemy loses the territory \you gain, his power stations' \output will decrease.
2500  = Tip:  Don't just wait in your Host Station \for energy to reload. Use the time to \fight or scout in the first person, as \your enemy is sure to be building up \his own forces.
2501  = Tip:  If at first you are unable to complete \a mission, you may need to acquire \technology upgrades from another \mission, from another game pathway, \before coming back to the uncompleted \mission.
2502  = Tip:  Different mission levels require \different strategies. Always assess \the situation at the beginning, starting \with the mission briefing, to develop \a step-by-step strategy toward \destroying the enemy.
2503  = Tip:  You can absorb energy residue \from destroyed vehicles if you take \first-person control of a vehicle and \drive through the enemy residue.
2504  = Tip:  Setting the correct aggressiveness \level for each squad at the correct \time is crucial. Levels can be quickly \set by pressing the numbers 1 to 5 \after selecting your squad.
2505  = Tip:  The more power you are absorbing \from power stations and surrounding \captured sectors, the quicker your \creation, beam, and Host Station life \energy reservoirs fill.
2506  = Tip:  Power stations you conquer become \free beam points. No matter how far \away, you can transport your Host \Station to them without expending any \energy.
2507  = Tip:  Systematically dismantle your \enemy's power structure. First, \destroy your enemy's power stations, \and then go after his host station.
2508  = Tip:  Each vehicle type has its own \advantages and disadvantages. While \creating vehicles, use the effectiveness \list in the lower right of your screen \to determine the right vehicle for \the job.
2509  = Tip:  Don't underestimate enemy scouts, as \they are the eye of the enemy. Destroy \enemy scouts at your first opportunity \to mask your location and tactics.
2510  = Tip:  In the Squadron Manager, \dragging a unit with the right \mouse button will also move \all units to its right.
2511  = Tip:  Press the Backspace key to jump \back into the last vehicle you occupied. \Press F8 to jump into the vehicle that \last sent you a message (denoted \by a blinking 'i').
2512  = Tip:  When joining your squads in battle, \try to jump into units just before they enter \battle rather than after it has begun. \This will give you the best field \orientation and edge in any battle.
