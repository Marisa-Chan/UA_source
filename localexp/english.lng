2101  = ... and finally tonight some bad news. \The sixth Resistance Champion selected \to engage in our multifront war has \perished under Ghorkovian hands. Falcons \in Missing Man formation will fly over \Hyde Park tomorrow during the scheduled \memorial. ... \     --Resistance Nightly News, \       3/17/2071 \ \BOTTOM LINE: You are going to die. But \read our mission briefings and we can \help you live longer. And who are we? We \are the stored memories of the best \Host Station masters who came before \you, went into battle and, upon death, \were digitally linked into the network. \We come bearing knowledge. \ \THE PLAN:  This is your final training \mission. This region is the foothold to \the rest of the continent and contains a \long-abandoned power station that, if \reacquired, can be reactivated to supply \power to our own Resistance forces \once again. Create several Foxes and \lead them 3 sectors SE to conquer the \power station. Then increase its energy \output by conquering as many \surrounding sectors as possible. Central \AI warns that Ghorkovian forces staged \at outlying fringes may interdict with \Ghargoil 1 attack helicopters. If so, \terminate with extreme prejudice.
2102  = ... The Fox? Fast. Ground-to-air capable.\Cheap. Hell yes--one of the best products\from Stoudson Corp. Wish we had more in \the early days. \     --From interview with retired Defense  \       General Weissflog \ \BOTTOM LINE:  The Ghorkovs zealously \guard Virgin Steel, as it includes the \area's only power station. You absolutely \must capture this power station sector in \the northwest corner. Central Encryption \believes that it has broken the Ghorkovian \power translation code, so you should be \able to plug into its power. After \capture, immediately beam your Host \Station to this sector and conquer the \surrounding sectors to maximize power \flow to your Host Station. The risk in \capturing versus destroying is that it \can be taken back. Beware of the dreaded \Ghorkovian fast-turbine landcraft: \the Speedy! \ \BIG NEWS:  Central AI reports that \somewhere within this region is a \technology upgrade sector for a powerful \new tank, the Jaguar.
2103  = And the teacher asked, 'Who can tell me \why the Moon has a dark side?'  'So it \would never have to see what happened \at Skull Alley,' the orphan replied. \     --Resistance Reader Magazine \ \BOTTOM LINE:  Skull Alley! The brutal \Ghorkovs turned it into a penal colony \and then a research center using our \captured scientists. Energy is \everything in this war. Capture the \Ghorkovian power station sector to the \northeast, and then regain the works \of our scientists by capturing the \technology upgrade sector to the \west. Beware of an elite Ghargoil 2 \squad, the Red Rain. \ \NOBODY LIKE YOU:  No machine can fight \with the skill and human heroics that \you possess. Every chance you get, \jump into a vehicle, lead the fight, and \pick up valuable plasma residue for \more energy. Your forces will enjoy an \advantage.
2104  = ... We've been at stalemate here so long\it's hard to tell who owns what \anymore. If someone can just break \through their flak line. ... \      --Interview with Resistance \       Med-Tech S. Priebus, staff #31767 \ \BOTTOM LINE:  We're fighting at Check-\Point Bordeaux, long known as \Checker Board for the patchwork of \Resistance and Ghorkovian sectors. Your\primary mission is to knock out the \enemy's line of gun stations on the \northern perimeter. Intelligence \reports that the Ghorkovs are test-\deploying a ferocious new tank, called \the Tekh-Trak. Also, this region's tech\upgrade will yield our new Wasp fighter \'copter. \ \YOUR PRESENCE REQUESTED:  We'll beam\into battle behind a line of our own \existing flak stations. Jump onto one of\the gun turrets to beat back advancing \forces. Your presence on the battlefield\will definitely be required for victory.\So jump into a vehicle and beware of the\Tekhs!
2105  = I freakin' told them but they didn't \listen!  Never, never enter battle \at Twin Rocks--the 'Kov's have a special \thing for that place. ... \      --SDU 5 Post-Death Debrief \       (restored 7/15/2016) \ \BOTTOM LINE:  Sorry, but our entry \coordinates are set for Twin Rocks: You \will see action immediately. Another \problem: Multiple Ghorkovian host  \stations have been detected, including \the more powerful Turantul II, which can \produce huge complements of \Ghargoil 2s. Central AI reports that a \Scout spy satellite can be captured in \a technology upgrade sector. Look for \a power source near you ASAP. \ \TAKING IT WITH YOU:  As you know, the \beam gate can take vehicles from one \mission to the next when you drive them \onto the beam gate platform before \transporting your Host Station to it. \We have recalibrated our Beam Gate \Network so that room for one more \vehicle is made each time you destroy \an enemy host station.
2106  = "Back when I was eight years old I used \to dream about turning 16. I'd be able to \rent hoverboards, and I'd be able to beam \gate by myself and visit friends in other \domes. At age eight living in a dome \seemed natural. But the great curse \of our parents and teachers were the \endless stories of how great it used to \be before the domes, when you could \breathe the air, eat food grown in the \ground, and actually fish something live \from out of the seas. So they told us of \a paradise we could never know, while we \lived with the endless stream of news \about how things outside were just \getting worse, and with the rumors that \if the energy plants ever went down, we \would all meet the same gasping death. \Kind of made a farce of that standard \childhood question: "And what do you \want to be when you grow up?"\ - From Leather Jacket \\After the godless supporters of the \Resistance had destroyed the parasite, \they did not stop bringing war over our \holy land. In the meantime they \completely captured our hereditary \territory. I must set off now...\\Even if someone else is at work and your \destiny may worry you, the strength of \minerals will always be inside of you."\ - Gimil Erdenfest, master of \   the stone-masons.\\The scouts reported about a battle \station of the Resistance which seems \to be busy building a new base for the \purpose of gaining more ground. They \already built two power stations. I \either have to take possession of them \or I must destroy them. Don't hesitate, \strike quickly using the Eisenhans and \take advantage of the element of \surprise. I was told that, on a hill in \the northeast, a small library can be \found in which I could take a look at \construction plans of an observance \satellite. Maybe this will help me...
2107  = The Kyternesian Militia National Council \(KMNC) announces: \\The propaganda of the "Resistance" has \been disseminated once again! All truth \was distorted! Our brave people are \denigrated by them as "Ghorkovs". In \Central Europe this fanatic group which \calls itself "Resistance" is attracting \more and more people. \\Our simple farmers who are essential in \order to supply our cities with food \have been kidnapped and tortured by the \immoral leaders of the "Resistance". The \farmers must bear the removal of their \limbs. Instead of their arms and legs, \cables and tubes are installed. At the end \they are fitted into terrible war machines \and have to follow the orders of this \fanatic group. The farmers who are not \put into such machines serve as feed or \component parts. We must take revenge \for this crime against our people! \\Our great leaders confirmed the will of \our people to defend freedom and peace. \All men, women and children from three \years on will be divided up into military \units of the Liberation Forces of Kyter-\nesia (LFK) according to § 00001b of the \Liberal Social Militia Regulations (LSMR). \\Please contact the next militia \administration immediately. They will \recruit you so that you can defend our \country. You are the heroes of our \nation! \\The secretary general of the Kyter-\nesian Militia and National Council (KMNC) \and head of the Liberation Forces of \Kyternesia (LFK), \Hajanyn Firunskofitsch.
2108  = "Unfortunately the human race has \evolved just enough science to all but \destroy their home planet, and just \enough technology to create some \formidable weapons. They don't show \signs of good planetary parenting. But \remember this is from the same world \that gave us dinosaurs."\ - From The Mykonian Papers: \   Intercepted Dispatches\\Cha Am, she will show us the way. The \harmonious effect of the four elements \must become reality through your deed \now...\\For some time heavy fights between \Ghorkovs and Mykonians have been going \on in the mountains. They are therefore \called "Mountains of Thunder" by the \inhabitants of the surrounding cities. \You must definitely capture the region \entirely so that the enemies won't find \a gap in the front to break through. We \have already managed to build two power \stations which you can use as home \bases without being noticed by the \enemy. To beat back the attacks of the \Ghorkovs who are stationed in the \northeast at the moment, we are \setting up an antiaircraft emplacement \at the entrance to the valley. Maybe you \will manage to break through to the \northeast by means of a combat patrol. \We hope that you will come into \possession of the construction plans of \a fighter there and that you will regain \this area for the order.\ - Sylvius Shlkavisoon, mentor.
2109  = <>
2110  = By the time we heard about the Mykonian \Labyrinth, the Ghorkovs were already \there, trying to figure  out just what \the weird terraforming Mykonians had \been up to. \      --SDU 2 Post-Death Debrief \       (restored 3/17/2014) \ \BOTTOM LINE:  Clear the Ghorkovs from \this giant maze so our scientists can \analyze why the Mykonians have been \digging labyrinths. Steeply walled terrain \will require careful planning. \Helicopters are advantageous if you \have them.  Launch Scout spy satellites to \locate power stations and technology \upgrade sectors, as we calculate their \presence at a 92.7% probability. \ \TIP:  When fighting in large battle \arenas, effectively monitor the action \by holding down the right mouse button \on the map and dragging quickly to move \the map around.
2111  = So, you're offering me life everlasting \in the Host Station Memory Bank, \right? It's a deal, if you'll just erase \everything I saw in Dark Valley. \      --Host Station Archives \       2231.44578.GSF.2-8-50 \ \BOTTOM LINE:  Everyone on the home \front is pulling for you. The Ghorkovs \have turned this once-industrial area \into a weapons manufacturing region. \You must destroy the Ghorkovian power \station sectors (north) to stop their \production  of new weapons. Also, a \Stoudson Bomb, capable of destroying all \enemies and buildings in the region \with a single shockwave, has been \activated somewhere in this region. It \will detonate and destroy all of your  \forces unless you deactivate it. You  \must proceed north to find the  \Stoudson Trigger sector (black and  \yellow square) and then conquer it to  \stop the bomb's countdown. The  \probability is 89.2% that you will  \encounter Speedy platoons and the  \ferocious dual-prop Ghargoil 3 bomber \'copter. Fortunately, we will beam into \battle just south of two of our own \power stations, although they still \need to be captured. \ \TIP:  Because transporting your \Host Station to a conquered power \station does not cost any beam \energy, no matter how far, hop from \one power station to another to \quickly move and deploy your forces \in this expansive region.
2112  = Is it magic? Some lost metaphysics? We all \know the Taerkastens are tied to the past. \But how do they float those fortresses? \      --Sequential Thoughts for Nonsequential \       Times \ \BOTTOM LINE:  Hate to send you so deep \into Taerkasten territory, but Central AI \reports the existence of a significant \technology upgrade that, if acquired, \will allow you to achieve tactical superiority \over Taerkasten armored divisions. You \will be up against the well-shielded \Leonid tanks, including some commanded \by an especially fanatical cell of the cult. \ \SURVIVAL GUIDE:  Among your predecessors  \here in the Memory Bank, there is a big \aversion to taking on Taerkastens this close \to their home. A prudent move would be to \capture that technology upgrade sector \and then head for the beam gate.
2113  = Today is a bad day. Again I received a \message that we had to give up another \sector. There is no more time left. \They must not gain our knowledge.... \to the west...\\Every stone is connected to the ideas \and the power of the universe.\\"Won another tournament at the Arcade. \Jan says I spend too much time there \but Jan's still got family to go home to  \an uncle and a second cousin. For me the \Arcade is like home. Plugging into a good \game is like going through your own beam \gate, into your own world. I pretend the \bad guys are Ghorkovs and Mykonians."\ - From Leather Jacket\\In these fields we have actually taken \a better stand than our enemies. We will \be able to beat back the offensives of \the Resistance quite well. The Resistance, \however, possesses some power \stations which they will protect with their \lives from our attacks. But a abandoned \library of great knowledge far away \in the western territory is mentioned \in some old documents. It seems that \the Resistance wants to hide their \knowledge from us. Perhaps this is the \key to our victory.
2114  = Speech of the secretary general of \the Kyternesian Militia National Council \(KMNC) and head of the Liberation Forces \of Kyternesia (LFK) Hajanyn Firuns-\kofitsch about the opening of fighting: \\"We have been deceived as a peaceful \community of this planet. The Resistance \is making degenerating propaganda \against our true people. Other nations are \to be set against us! We are not going to \let that happen!!! Our people are prepared \to fight. Our inherited area will be \defeated to the last! No peace of land \will be given up for lost!" \\Your instructions for further actions: \You will find an unprotected entrance to \the Resistian plateau. A hostile power \station can be used as a beam gate for \your Tarantul I. Take advantage of this \power station as a starting point for your \attacks. According to our secret service, \you can find important technologies in \this sector. \\General Yumirin will put some of his \Tekh-Traks at your disposal. Make use of \them, exclusively against hostile anti-\aircraft stations! You cannot expect \further support from us.
2115  = Now the real war begins. All that \you've learned is put into practice. \     --Central AI
2116  = "Your goal is unfathonal spirit, highest \crown. It is the manifestation of the \philosopher's stone, the last secret, \incomprehensible to all created beings. \Your way will lead you through the \alchemist's mixture of stone, a spirit \to the eternal enlightenment. Your glory \will defeat your enemies and encourage \your companions."\\We know about your weakness. We will \help you. The Order of Prophets knows a \abandoned power station in the eastern \territory. It will be your first base in the \enemies' country. Take the two libraries \in the western area. That way you will \have a second base. Extend them and \don't let your enemies come too close.\ - Sylvius Shlkavisoon, mentor.\\"At my mom's funeral the minister came \up to me and said, "She's in a better \place." I said, "Duhh!" That got me stuck \in counseling for about two years. The \remaining adults are scared about how \many of us kids are deciding to off \ourselves. And so we get sent to \therapists, and these therapists are \good, really good. For example, mine \said, 'You've got so much to live for.' \And she didn't even laugh." \ - From Leather Jacket\\"The ones who should already be masters, \need on the other hand someone to \show them the first steps on their way \in this world."\ - Hera Daleth, Priestess of \   the Sisters of the Earth.\\The Order of Prophets is telling me \about a great battle between the godless \supporters of the Resistance and the \Ghorkovs. This is the first step to our \victory: they have been driven out of \the south. But you can never know, they \are only striving for power over the \holy earth. An alliance with them would \never be a possibility for us.
2117  = The chief of staff of the development \executive of the Liberation Forces of \Kyternesia, Hung-Ce Bobarar about \Ghagoil 2: \\"Having come through the baptism of fire \by a Ghagoil 1, the difficult way of bravery \leads to Ghagoil 2. Its double arming with \an extremely strong armoring makes it \well-known even beyond the bounds of \our administration. The enemy respects \and fears it! Many old soldiers of the \Liberation Forces of Kyternesia use these \Ghagoil 2 helicopters exclusively. The \strong armoring in connection with the \double arming are unfortunately resulting \in a slightly slower speed and maneuver-\ability. This, however, is compensated \many times. Actions against Leonids of \the sect of the mistaken Taerkasten \Order are easy to handle even for our \inexperienced soldiers. This helicopter is \well-armed in case that hostile anti-air-\craft and battle stations will attack us." \\Man next to him wearing a dark coat: \\"Your next task is very difficult. Your \starting point is surrounded by hostile \artillery. The Resistance won't hesitate \to detonate the installed bomb if it is \taken into the area... \Up north you will find an interesting \extension of technology. The entrance to \the Resistian hollow is not very closely \guarded there.
2118  = "Been filling some of my wasted hours \online, reading about the way things \used to be. Funny to read all the hand-\wringing news about how divorce used to \pull families apart. Talk about the good \old days! Hardly any of my friends have \parents anymore, and I'm just 16. \Divorce, give me a break! By the time \the first domes were finished most of \our parents had been exposed to so many \of the viral waves, and had breathed air \so polluted and eaten food so mutated, \that most were dead within five years - \even if they were lucky enough to make \it into a dome. Supposedly we are the \Clean Generation, but who knows what \kind of weirdnesses are crawling around in \our DNA. Maybe we'll be the first \generation in history to actually wish we \had parents. For now, back to the \arcades." \ - From Leather Jacket\\"The spirit of the earth is a form of the \final cognition of being."\ - Jarek Manasse, \   true prophet and heretic.\\"As you can see on the map, you will get \in touch with two Resistian battle \stations in this area quite soon. We have \learned from a refugee ,who survived \the attack of that time, that we could \find power stations of the Resistance \in the southeastern sector which are not \closely guarded. We will beam you onto a \plateau from where you can start your \attack on the power stations without \being seen right away. There are two \libraries in this area. We have marked \one on the map. The only thing we know \about the other one is the fact that it \can be found right by a huge house in \the northwestern area and that you can \find a useful construction plan for a \vehicle there."\ - Sylvius Shlkavisoon, mentor.
2119  = The Kyternesian Militia National Council \announces: \"Any desertion will result in the identi-\fication of this person as a supporter \of the "Resistance".

2120  = Everything about the Mykonians scared \us--including their cubical ships all \covered with organic tubing. We called \them worm boxes, because that stuff \moved and looked alive. \      --From interview with retired pilot\       D. Mansbart \ \BOTTOM LINE:  This is a risky operation \due to multiple enemies--both \Ghorkovs AND Mykonians--but it is \essential for opening the northern \territories. Your mission is to seek \out and destroy the Ghorkovian \and Mykonian sources of power. Two \recon helis have been predeployed in \a northeastern sector near a \Mykonian power station. Theoretically, \we should be able to obtain this \region's tech upgrades and weaken \the enemy powerbase while the \Ghorkovs and Mykonians are busy \fighting each other. Central AI \calculates that your success rate \may be substantially higher if you \enter this region possessing power \station building  technology.  \ \THINKING OF YOU:  You have impressed \the core AI elements, as you have \progressed farther than 53.9% of your \SDU predecessors. Welcome to the \A-List.
2121  = The Stoudson Bomb was certainly \designed by committee! All those trigger \points--and if someone gets there first, \Goodbye!\ --Bernd Beyreuther, former Stoudson \    Corp. VP of Special Projects\\BOTTOM LINE:  Drak contains the \much-rumored Stoudson Bomb, capable \of destroying all enemies and \buildings in the region with a single\shockwave. The bomb requires multiple\trigger points (black/yellow key \sectors) to be conquered in order to\detonate. Unfortunately, a design \error allows it to be triggered by \enemies as well. Whoever owns all \Stoudson Bomb key sectors and the \bomb itself will annihilate the entire \region. Prevent it from falling into \enemy hands. \ \ENGINEERING REQUEST:  Central AI reports \a technology upgrade sector for creating\power stations. This is your most critical\acquisition to date. Marshal all resources\to gain it.
2122  = Are they alive?  No, but given the way \they'll sometimes show up unannounced \to help defend a host station, it makes \you wonder. \     --Substrate Zero: Artificial \       Intelligence & Being \ \BOTTOM LINE:  Another multifront battle: \The Taerkastens have built a massive \radar station on top of Pedestal \Mountain, guarding it with their own \version of the Stoudson Bomb. They \have been using this Pedestal radar \site to monitor your travails on this \continent. Word has it the Ghorkovs \want it for themselves. Destroy the \radar completely so that it does not \fall into any enemy hands, and then take \out the Ghorkovian and Taerkasten power \stations. \ \SURVIVAL GUIDE:  We beam into the \theater at Pillar Rocks. Capture the \unclaimed power station to the east. \Beware of the Taerkasten Hetzel, an \ancient-looking but deadly plane usually \deployed in large squads. The Ghorkovs \have brought their Ghargoil 3s. A wise  \tactic is to delay the onslaught by  \destroying enemy scout satellites as  \soon as you see them, because your  \enemies cannot deploy units to  \sectors they cannot see..
2123  = The Taerkastens are a mystery. \Supposedly they were the first humans \to meet the Mykonians--a horrific \encounter that sent them into a cultlike \fervor to save Earth from the aliens. \Cool! But why kill us, too? \      --Teenage Manifesto: Thoughts on \       Joining The Resistance \ \BOTTOM LINE:  You have ventured as far \as SDU 5 before we lost contact. Primary \goal: Knock out the Taerkasten Flying \Fortress and its power stations to the \southwest. Central AI reports that \SDU 5's abandoned power station to the \northeast can be reclaimed and tapped \for power as the launch pad of your \major offensive here. \ \SCOUTING AROUND:  To discover hidden \power stations as well as enemy \concentrations, create a Scout. Send it \out on its own, or fly it yourself for a  \bird's-eye view.

2130  = The Mykonian flak station, that \pulsating ring of blue, has a hypnotic \beauty, and the desire to barbecue you. \      --The Hexagon Papers \ \BOTTOM LINE:  We beam into an existing \standoff between the Ghorkovs and \Mykonians to capture a crucial \technology upgrade--the ability to \create  flak stations. Mission: Find and \acquire this tech upgrade, and destroy \both the Ghorkovian and Mykonian \power sources. Be advised that both \enemies are heavily fortified by their \own high-density flak batteries. So \invest in well-armored units when  \rushing enemy positions, and try to find \weak penetration points. Lastly, the  \Ghorkovs have deployed a highly  \accurate squad of Ghargoil 3 bombers in  \this region, so protect your power  \stations with good anti-air units such  \as Foxes.\ \ENGINEERING REQUEST:  The AI Engineering \Module reminds you that each technology \upgrade is vital for future missions.  \Try to acquire all of them.
2131  = Question: The Ghorkovs are human. The \Taerkastens are human. The Resistance \are human. Why can't they get along? \Answer: Because they are human. \      --Joke from a decoded Mykonian \       textbook \ \BOTTOM LINE:  The Clone Commanders, twin \Ghorkovian generals who always fight \side by side, are guarding two power \stations with their twin Turantul IIs. \Central AI believes that they are \readying this plasma-rich region for a \Gigant repair facility. We have lost \two SDU champions here. If you can \reclaim their power stations, we may \have a chance. \ \DIPLOMATIC DISPATCH:  Reports that the  \Ghorkovs hate The Resistance because we \tried to sell them out to the Mykonians \are categorically denied--but true.
2132  = Those Taerkasten crazies like  \their iron and stone,  \Make it float with their  \metaphysical tome.  \Want to kill all on Earth, \and make it their own. \      --The Dying Planet Blues \ \ BOTTOM LINE:  This region is the most \expansive to date, so dig in and plan \on a protracted effort. Prior to losing \SDU 2 here, it was noted that the \Ghorkovs had begun a massive buildup \in this region for unknown reasons. \Your critical assignment is to \ascertain who has the upper hand \and to eliminate all sources of enemy \power. Clearing this region will allow \you to continue farther into the \African continent and perhaps figure \out what the Taerkastens and \Ghorkovs are so afraid of. \ \TIP:  Central AI believes that your  \success rate will be the highest if  \you can first orchestrate a plan to  \damage the Taerkasten powerbase by  \taking out their power station to the  \northwest.
2133  = The Standing Stones of New Stonehenge \are additional evidence that the \Taerkastens not only  worship rock but \have also found a way to draw power from \it. Is this why the Mykonians came? \      --Professor Uli Weinberg, quoted in\       Resistance Quarterly \ \BOTTOM LINE:  We beam into the heart of \Taerkasten holy country to seek out and \terminate key Taerkasten Druids within \their military order.

Of course, this castle \is therefore an important tactical target \concerning our fight for freedom for our \suppressed nation.\\You better expect an enormous defense \from the side of the Taerkasten! They \won't let us have their knowledge just \like that. The committee for communi-\cation and information (CCI) has already \created a favorable starting position \for you: close to this point you will \find a power station, two others are at \the other side of this area. Many attacks \from different directions will irritate \the Taerkasten system of defense.\\Your most important weapon in this fight \will be the Ghagoil 3. But the technology \sector could not be installed in an area \which is easy to reach for you. The \attacks of the Taerkasten against our \small special unit of the CCI would be too \hard.

Yuen, lead engineer at \       Resistance Research \ \BOTTOM LINE:  The original mission \parameters for SDU 6 were routine: \Destroy the Ghorkovian Ivory Tower \embassy to the southeast and capture \the Dragonfly tech upgrade.  However, \we have discovered that the Ghorkovs \are already engaged in heavy melee with \the Mykonians and will not hesitate \to engage your forces immediately with \battle-hardened battalions.

Then the Mykonians came,  \destroyed everyone, and sent sentient \snaking bionic extrusions out to prepare \the sector for parasitic conversion. \Reclaim all power stations in the region \away from enemy hands. \ \THE TOMORROW MAKERS:  No one has \progressed as far as you. Our analysts \are recalibrating your odds in our war \models. Continue your assault on the \Mykonians toward Parasite City.

When the Black Sect \enters battle, deal with them \immediately--and deal with them \completely. \     --Retired SDU Mentor J. Mayo, \       Hyde Park Archives \ \BOTTOM LINE:  Prepare for a long and \exhausting battle. The Anubis Canyons \are huge and contain the heart of the \dreaded Black Sect operations.

Air units are \advised to avoid the maze terrain. \ \YOU HAVE COMPANY:  In hopes of knocking \off the Black Sect as well, the Ghorkovs \have deployed their new host station--\the Skorpio class--in this region. Your \secondary objective is to take out their \supply depot and power stations \southwest of you. It's as if everyone is \heading for Parasite City, yet everyone \wants to arrive alone.

The source of the leak  \has been traced to SDU 1,  whom we \assume has defected due to her \sudden and mysterious disappearance \in this region.

We will \monitor your actions to learn. It is \believed that two powerful Myko stations \inhabit this region. Our records \indicate possible Resistance power \station technology somewhere north of \insertion point. \ \NEXT STOP:  Parasite City.

I'll take a decisive \SDU with a wreck of a host station any \day. \     --Resistance High Council Member \       G.

Perhaps the Ghorkovs, \Taerkastens, Black Sect, and Resistance \arms race exists solely to send every \damn one of us back into the stone age. \     --Journal Entry of SDU 2 \ \BOTTOM LINE:  All human factions have\ martialed their remaining forces here \for an imminent confrontation with the \Mykonians. The High Council sees this as \an opportunity to weaken all factions' \powerbases prior to Parasite City. Seek \out and destroy the cluster of enemy \power stations toward the region's \center.

Your primary \mission objective is to find either one \of two beam gates in the region and \extract your forces through and on to \Parasite City. However, all human \factions have marshaled their \remaining forces here as well, so the \High Council sees an opportunity to rid \ourselves of our Terran enemies once \and for all. \ \NOTE:  The Black Sect has control of \a  Stoudson Bomb in this region.  \Adjust mission parameters with  \discretion. Many AI drones have been  \remotely redeployed to this region  \to support you.

2490  = Tip:  Playing the first three training missions \and watching the training videos are \HIGHLY recommended.
2491  = Tip:  The human factor is key to victory, \so take first-person control of your \vehicles as much as possible. No AI can \match the Intangibles of Human \Leadership.
2492  = Tip:  Three keys to winning are: acquire \power stations, expand your territory \to increase your power stations' output, \and take first-person control of your \vehicles.
2493  = Tip:  Jumping into a vehicle dramatically \increases its firepower, firing rate, \maneuverability, and shielding. Your \direct first-person control makes a \vast difference.
2494  = Tip:  Energy is essential for survival. \Conquer power stations and then acquire \surrounding sectors to increase their \output.
2495  = Tip:  When you take direct control of \a unit, you may press the L key to become \the squad leader.  Any target you \shoot at will become your entire \squad's target.
2496  = Tip:  Pay attention to your energy \absorption, shown in the upper-left \corner of the screen. If the percentage \is low, conquer more sectors to increase \your power stations' output.
2497  = Tip:  All power stations you own require  \a certain number of conquered  \sectors to support them before they  \are at optimal power output.  \For each white box on your power  \station, you must own 16 more  \sectors to become 100% efficient.
2498  = Tip:  When flying a helicopter, raise the \throttle to gain lift, and then move \forward by tilting the helicopter slightly \forward. Hit the brake to auto-level.
2499  = Tip:  Capture as many sectors as \possible to expand your territory and \increase your power stations' output. \As your enemy loses the territory \you gain, his power stations' \output will decrease.
2500  = Tip:  Don't just wait in your Host Station \for energy to reload. Use the time to \fight or scout in the first person, as \your enemy is sure to be building up \his own forces.
2501  = Tip:  If at first you are unable to complete \a mission, you may need to acquire \technology upgrades from another \mission, from another game pathway, \before coming back to the uncompleted \mission.
2502  = Tip:  Different mission levels require \different strategies. Always assess \the situation at the beginning, starting \with the mission briefing, to develop \a step-by-step strategy toward \destroying the enemy.
2503  = Tip:  You can absorb energy residue \from destroyed vehicles if you take \first-person control of a vehicle and \drive through the enemy residue.
2504  = Tip:  Setting the correct aggressiveness \level for each squad at the correct \time is crucial. Levels can be quickly \set by pressing the numbers 1 to 5 \after selecting your squad.
2505  = Tip:  The more power you are absorbing \from power stations and surrounding \captured sectors, the quicker your \creation, beam, and Host Station life \energy reservoirs fill.
2506  = Tip:  Power stations you conquer become \free beam points. No matter how far \away, you can transport your Host \Station to them without expending any \energy.
2507  = Tip:  Systematically dismantle your \enemy's power structure. First, \destroy your enemy's power stations, \and then go after his host station.
2508  = Tip:  Each vehicle type has its own \advantages and disadvantages. While \creating vehicles, use the effectiveness \list in the lower right of your screen \to determine the right vehicle for \the job.
2509  = Tip:  Don't underestimate enemy scouts, as \they are the eye of the enemy. Destroy \enemy scouts at your first opportunity \to mask your location and tactics.
2510  = Tip:  In the Squadron Manager, \dragging a unit with the right \mouse button will also move \all units to its right.
2511  = Tip:  Press the Backspace key to jump \back into the last vehicle you occupied. \Press F8 to jump into the vehicle that \last sent you a message (denoted \by a blinking 'i').
2512  = Tip:  When joining your squads in battle, \try to jump into units just before they enter \battle rather than after it has begun. \This will give you the best field \orientation and edge in any battle.
